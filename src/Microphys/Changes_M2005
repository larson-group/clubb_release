Changes (bloss, Apr 09):

 + Modified scheme to use total water (vapor + cloud liquid) as a
prognostic variable in place of separate vapor and cloud liquid
variables.  This should reduce the cost associated with scalar
advection.  With this scheme, saturation adjustment occurs before
calling the microphysics, so that a consistent set of temperature,
water vapor and cloud liquid values can be input to the microphysics.
This saturation adjustment could be more expensive than the old one
within the microphysics, since you do not have a reference value of
cloud liquid to start from.

 + The latent heating due to the microphysics is not readily
accessible with the total water formulation, so that it is no longer
output in the statistics.

 + The EFFRQ* effective radius outputs in the past were susceptible to
errors due to non-uniformity of hydrometeor fractions across
processors or time steps.  As a result, these outputs have been
eliminated.  In their place, a new output Q*OEFFR which represents a
scaled version of the layer optical depth has been added.  This can be
used to compute a consistent effective radius from the averaged
optical depth and mixing ratio.  For example, the cloud liquid
effective radius may be computed as:

  EFFRC = QC / QCOEFFR

where QC is in g/kg, QCOEFFR is in g/kg/micron and EFFRC is in
microns.

 + The default setting for dopredictNc was changed to .false.
Now, by default, the cloud liquid droplet concentration will be set to
Nc0 which itself has a default value of 100./cm3.

Changes (UW Milwaukee, as of August 2014)

A brief summary of what has been changed from the original SAM code is as follows:

1. The subroutine M2005MICRO_GRAUPEL has had changes from the equivalent WRF subroutine
that handle changes due to sedimentation for long timesteps.

2. The subgrid-scale cloud fraction from the CLUBB parameterization is now fed into the
above subroutine, and used to divide the grid boxes into a clear portion where it is
assumed no rain, et cetera forms, and a cloudy portion where vapor is temporarily set
to saturation with respect to liquid.  This is intended to give a better solution when running
SAM-CLUBB as coarse horizontal resolutions.

3. A subroutine POS_QV_ADJ has been added to prevent vapor water mixing ratio from becoming
negative.  This seems to usually happen the SGS cloud fraction code is used and other species
grow too quickly in a single timestep.  The code takes a single "k" level of the altitude and
attempts to fill the missing vapor by converting some of the total present at that altitude
back into vapor water mixing ratio.  Since this code is called after sedimentation is applied
it can sometimes fail to "fill the hole".

4. Numerous budget terms from module_mp_graupel code have extracted for output to the SAM
stat file.  These can be very useful for analyzing what processes are influencing a simulation.

5. The namelist variable dospecifyaersol was changed from a logical to an integer.
Its new definition is:
0 = no aerosol mode
1 = power-law
2 = lognormal

6. The calculation of SGS variance of vertical velocity is taken from CLUBB 
parameterization (variable wp2 in the code) and used for aerosol activation.  
Again, this is to improve results at horizontal coarse resolutions, which typically
cannot resolve updrafts and downdrafts as well as hires LES simulation.
