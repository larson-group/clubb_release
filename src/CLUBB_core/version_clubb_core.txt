    Add scripts to configure and run convergence test
     This commit contains new scripts created to configure and run
     convergence test simulations. There are four scripts:
    
     1. run_scripts/run_cnvg_test_multi_cases.csh. This script is used to
        compile and run convergence simulations with specific configurations
        (see details in scripts for explations). After the simulations,the
        space-time convergence plots will also be generated.
    
     2.run_scripts/convergence_config.py: this script "called" by the
       first script to generate the namelist file for CLUBB-SCM simulations.
       With this script, the modified configuration will be applied in the
       case run directory, while the files in default clubb will not be
       touched
    
     3.run_scripts/convergence_function.py: this script contains function
       to modify the initial condition profile for convergence test
       simulations. It is called by run_scripts/convergence_config.py
       when the model is configured to use modified initial conditions
    
     4.run_scripts/plot_l2_convergence.py: this is a sample script to
       generate the space-time convergence plots

    This commit most definitely does not change any bits,
    but commit 67878ef was BIT_CHANGING for the DYCOMS-II RF02 family
    of cases, RICO (and RICO SILHS), BOMEX, and Wangara.

    Implementing changes to the initial conditions.
    This commit contains code changes related to the modified initial
    conditions for convergence test simulations. These code changes can be
    activated by setting l_modify_ic_with_cubic_int = .true. in
    the namelist on a case-by-case basis.
    
    Along with this option, the sounding profiles are also modified for
    the BOMEX, RICO, DYCOMS2_RF02 and Wangara cases.
    
     -- For BOMEX, RICO, Wangara cases, we add more height levels in the
        original sounding profiles so that the cubic spline interpolation
        produces consistent profiles with those with linear interpolation
    
     -- For DYCOMS2_RF02, instead of using the formulations in the code to
        derive the initial condition profiles (which will results in the
        grid-spacing dependent initial condition when we refine grid), we
        construct a sounding profiles (still use the same formulas as in
        the src/sounding.F90) on a high-resolution grid (refine the standard
        grid by a factor of 2^7), then save the profile in
        dycoms2_rf02_sounding.in. In this way, the model initiliazation will
        always read the same sounding profile for initialization when user
        refine the vertical model grid.

    * Clubb ticket #1025: Implemented way to make esa tuner reproducible, hid error output of optional diagnostic variables behind check, fixed parallelization issue with tuner, esa max_iters parameter is now in stats namelist, fixed issue with TUNER compiler directive, some small fixes.
    - New namelist variables prescribed_rand_seed and l_use_prescribed_rand_seed determine if the esa tuner will use a random or a fixed value as random seed. Added descriptions to README.
    - Added max_iters to stats namelist to make it more modifiable.
    - Renamed stp_adjst_intercept_in and stp_adjst_slope_in to stp_adjst_shift_in and stp_adjst_factor_in, respectively, to better reflect their influence on step size.
    - The error output in src/CLUBB_core/pdf_closure_module.F90 for the diagnostic variables wprtp2, wpthlp2, wprtpthlp, and rcp2 is now hidden behind existence checks for these variables. And a clarification was added to "#ifdef TUNER" directive.
    - NetCDF file access caused the tuner to crash in parallel mode (-fopenmp flag in config file and multiple cases). Adding an $OMP CRITICAL structure around the call to stats_init in clubb_driver.F90 fixed that.
    - Fixed compile/README. Config files are specified with the -c option.
    - The -t option in run_scripts/run_tuner.bash interfered with the previous usage of the TUNER compiler directive. Renamed the old TUNER directive to NR_SP, a short for "numerical recipes, single precision". TUNER now is the option to "turn on" code changes required to run the tuner.

    Removing usage of gr from pdf_closure. It was only ever used for nz, which is now fed in directly.

    Fixing bug. This was only triggered when l_input_fields=.true., which I am only testing because it needs to be true so that I can test ADG2_driver.
