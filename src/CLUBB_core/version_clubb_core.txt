    I have resolved all the issues surrounding recent CLUBB commits that
    remove "use" statements from the code.  The commit 068a7b2 (April 8, 2020) was
    the commit before these refactorings started.  When Lscale, Skw_zm, and thvm
    are passed out of CLUBB core, the code returns to a bit-for-bit match to commit
    068a7b2.  However, rather than pass these variables out of advance_clubb_core,
    it is more convenient to recalculate them locally in clubb_driver.  This
    changes results for (a) SILHS cases, owing to the change to Lscale, and (b) all
    cases that advance microphysics, owing to the change to Skw_zm.  The net result
    is that this commit is BIT_CHANGING.  For cases that advance microphysics and/or
    use SILHS, the net result is BIT_CHANGING when compared to 068a7b2.  For all
    other cases (BOMEX, etc.), the results are an exact match.
    
    It is important to note that host models that use CLUBB (without SILHS) will not
    be affected by these changes.  Host models that use SILHS will only be affected
    by the change to Lscale.  However, this code has already been applied to CAM and
    E3SM, so the only changes will to SILHS code in SAM and WRF.

    Results were changed yesterday for some cases because thlprcp was
    no longer being output from advance_clubb_core for use in the
    calculate_thlp2_rad.  This was previously accomplished through a
    "use" statement.  The variable thlprcp is now output through the
    argument list of advance_clubb_core.
    
    This commit is BIT_CHANGING.

    Removing the reference to variables_diagnostic_module (sigma_sqd_w_zt and rtm_ref)
    from subroutine pdf_closure_driver in advance_clubb_core.

    I "brought back the stats" by passing the stats from advance_clubb_core
    to stats_accumulate, getting rid of the "use" statements.
    
    This commit is BIT_CHANGING, since it changes stats output.

    I am replacing the "use" statements that referenced
    variables_diagnostic_module from advance_clubb_core and replacing
    them with local declarations.  This requires that some
    additional variables are passed into and out of advance_clubb_core.
    
    Additionally, Lscale is now recalculated outside of advance_clubb_core
    using TKE and Kh for use in SILHS code.  This makes this commit
    BIT_CHANGING.
