    Porting pdf_closure subroutine with OpenACC (#1059)
    
    * Porting pdf_closure subroutine with OpenACC
    
    OpenACC directives are added to pdf_closure subroutine. The necessary
    structured data region is also added for optimzing data movement across
    kernels. There is opportunity to task parallelize using streams and
    will be explored in the future.
    
    Answers are bit for bit.
    
    * Fixing the copyin directives
    
    * Making work without managed memory.

    Fixing bug, arrays given a dummy index in 0fafc6b0b1f1a6058d37bf3db4bb3708204504db are declared nsize, but are only used up to nlevels, thus we need the (1,1:nlevels) specifier when passing them. This issue was only caught by our _debug tests, so that's good evidence the new flags we added to initialize unused to memory was effective.

    Removing update_pressure since it is no longer called anywhere in clubb or host models. The addition of this subroutine was discussed in larson-group/e3sm#6 and the removal of the call to it was discussed in larson-group/clubb#926.

    Also abbreviates the clubb parameter names in the plots.
