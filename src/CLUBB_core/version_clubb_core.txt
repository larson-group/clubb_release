    Small bug fix, but this is BIT_CHANGING because it affects stats output. Some zm fields (w_1_zm, w_2_zm, varnce_w_1_zm, varnce_w_2_zm, and mixt_frac_zm) were all nan in the netcdf output when l_call_pdf_closure_twice=.false., because those come from pdf_params_zm.

    Making clubb_at_least_debug_level not a device routine. It confuses the poor little nvidia compiler when compiling inside cam. Also making the compile script a little more robust.

    New fill_holes methods (#1262)
    
    * Adding little code bits to help explore fill_holes. This is just a diagnostic playground
    
    * Improvements
    
    * Maybe better algorithm?
    
    * Improvements to the new fill holes
    
    * Nice progress
    
    * Small tweaks
    
    * Mainly adding gptl option for cmake and new run_timestep_tests.py
    
    * Making namelist input for fill type, and adding ANOTHER new filler that should be completely parallelizable, but right now large hole groups steal too much from nearby points and it looks kinda bad.
    
    * Big improvements, new algorithm is good now
    
    * Small updates
    
    * Making new fill_holes_type flag for clubb_config_flags
    
    * New hybrid filler
    
    * Small fixes

    * Bunch of things
    
    * Updates
    
    * small fix
    
    * Various cleanup and comments
    
    * Small improvement to p_atomic
    
    * Updates for speed mainly
    
    * Small improvement to p_atomic
    
    * Potential improvement to p_atomic
    
    * Updates for speed mainly
    
    * Updates to make G_unit fill holes test
    
    * Improving new tests and making widening_windows and smart_window work in flipped grid mode
    
    * All methods passing G_unit test, still need a little cleanup
    
    * Slight comments update
    
    * Cleanup
    
    * Adding named constants for fill type
    
    * Uncommentting source checks after compile

    * Small fixes
    
    * Small fixes
    
    * Mainly comments
    
    * Making G_unit test use the new python script and compiler method. Small bug fix too
    
    * Little fixes
