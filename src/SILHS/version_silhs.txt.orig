    Making it so sclr_tol is set to 0 before the specified sclr_tol_in. This is so that it is initialized to 0 in the case that sclr_dim = 0, since now we are setting it to have a minimum allocation size of 1 and would otherwise have a garbage value. This is what broke the clubb_openmp_gfortran_test.

    Fixing a labelling error in redirect_interpolated_azt_2D and similar procedures, since this interpolates to zt the input should be zm. I think this was my fault, so I cleaned all the zt2zm and zm2zt things up to make it a little nicer. Also ordered the routines _k _1D _2D to make it easier to jump around, it was a bit confusing as they were out of order and the typo really made it hard.

    Small tweaks to fix some GPU bugs. Some variables were uninitialized on the CPU while we were saving them. This could only have been caught by comparing consecutive runs and checking _zt and _zm files, even then few cases were having problems.

    Small improvements to diff_netcdf_outputs.py, removing reliance on ncdiff, now it is entirely in python. Cleaning up linux_x86_64_nvhpc_gpu.bash, removing outdated parts, improving default parallel compilation, changing pgfortran to nvfortran.

    Advance xm wpxp gpuization (#1077)
    
    * Initial commit for GPUizing advance_xm_wpxp.
    
    * GPUizing fill_holes_vertical
    
    * Adding Skthl_zm to the update host list, I missed this in the last PR. I noticed this by comparing results with and without managed memory, now I've checked BFBness with arm, mpace_b, mc3e, and gabls2.
    
    * Small GPU fixes (#1076)
    
    * Fixing small things that I caught by adding the default(present) onto acc loops.
    
    * Moving default(present) to the end because it looks nicer there.
    
    * Adding default(present) to all acc loop statements. Also adding azt to a copyin statement, which was missed previously. All BFB.
    
    * Incemental update, not well tested yet.
    
    * Removing some copies and making the sclr_dim change.
    
    * Fixing a bug that only seemed detectable with astex_a209. We need to pass only single arrays to functions, calling ddzt( nz, ngrdcol, gr, rho_ds_zt * K_zt_nu ) was resulting in rho_ds_zt * K_zt_nu being evluated on the CPU, but the values were only valid on the GPU. So we need to evaluate that expression on the GPU, save it into an array (currently K_zt_nu_tmp), then pass that to ddzt.
    
    * GPUizing calc_turb_adv_range
    
    * GPUizing mono_flux_limiter
    
    * Cleaning up data statments and a couple other things.
    
    * Updated for some different options.
    
    * More updates needed for various options.
    
    * Reverting accidental flag change
    
    * Should be the final changes, all options tested now.
    
    * Replacing some comments in monoflux limiter, and also modifying it to make it BFB on CPUs. Also changing incorrect error conditions on tridiag.
    
    * Adding max_x_allowable to update host statement, missed previous.
    
    * Properly naming tmp variables and variables calculated from ddzt and ddzm start with ddzt_ and ddzm_.
    
    * Replacing constants with named ones from constants_clubb.
    
    * Replacing hard coded numbers in lhs variables representing the number of bands they contain with fortran parameters.

    This commit contains code changes to implement modifications on limiters in three places:
    
    1. remove the limiters in denominator of equation for
       brunt_vaisala_freq_sqd_smth, which affects the computed
       eddy dissipation time scale in turbulent fluxes (wpxp).
       (in mixing_length.F90)
    
    2. reduce the threshold values of limiters in the equation
       for richardson number (sqrt_Ri_zm)
       (in mixing_length.F90)
    
    3. introduce the smoothed max/min function for limiters in
       equation of Cx_fnc_Richardson.
       (in advance_helper_module.F90).
    
    After the modification, we also apply a zt2m(zm2zt) smoothing
    on the calculated quantities. These modifications are found to
    be benificial for improving solution convergence in CLUBB-SCM
    
    The code changes are controlled by a newly introduced flag named
    "l_modify_limiters_for_cnvg_test", which is set to .false. (meaning that
    the modificaitons on limiters is turned off) by default.

    Code changes to implement modificiations on wp3 clippings
    This commit contains code changes to implement modifications of skewness
    clippings on wp3 in src/CLUBB_core/clip_explicit.F90. The default method attempts
    to apply smaller (larger) clippings below (above) 100m AGL level, which
    can cause a discontinuities around 100m AGL level. This clippings is
    found to trigger sawthooth oscillations in wp3 when linear diffusion is
    used. Such swathooth oscillations are eleminated if a smoothed Heaviside
    function is introduced to obtain a smooth transition of clippings at
    around 100m AGL level. The changes is necessary to obtain the first
    order convergence in CLUBB-SCM when lienar diffusion is used.
    
    Previously committed by Shixuan.

    Implements Thomas Toniazzo's bug fix for spike removal
    
    in the monotonic flux limiter.  See
    
    https://github.com/larson-group/clubb_release/pull/11/files
    
    This code change is
    expected to be BIT_CHANGING for cases in which
    `l_predict_upwp_vpwp = T`, `l_mono_flux_lim_um = T`
    or `l_mono_flux_lim_vm = T`, and the monotonic
    flux limiter is triggered.
    
    This bug fix prevents non-conservation of momentum
    when the vertical integral of either of the wind components `um` or `vm` is negative.

    Gpu updates (#1070)
    
    * Fixing bug. This was only triggered when l_input_fields=.true., which I am only testing because it needs to be true so that I can test ADG2_driver.
    
    * Removing usage of gr from pdf_closure. It was only ever used for nz, which is now fed in directly.
    
    * Making openacc statements more consistent. Ensuring all statments on double loops have specified gang and vector, and that all parallel loops have an end parallel loop statment at the end of them. Everything BFB on CPUs and GPUs.
    
    * Pushing acc data region to outermost parts of mixing_length.
    
    * Removing pdf_implicit_coefs_terms from acc copyin and copyout. It is only used when iiPDF_type == iiPDF_new .or. iiPDF_type == iiPDF_new_hybrid, so we do not need to do any copying with it. The inclusion of it also caused the data statement to copy unallocated arrays, which are just garbage pointers, and that was causing random occasional crashes (either segfaults or gpu out of memory).
    
    * The update device clauses for return variables seems to only be requried for arrays contained in types. See https://github.com/larson-group/clubb/issues/1049\#issuecomment-1440624778
    
    * Moving acc end data to end of pdf_closure. This reuqired removing any conditional return statements that appear before the final return, since we're not allowed to branch out of an acc region early. I also moved a large printout statement outside of a loop. The only reason it was in the loop to begin with was because pdf_params used to be an array of types, but now is a type of arrays, allowing us to print the full arrays directly.
    
    * Making loop an acc loop. If we weren't outputting w_[up/down]_in_cloud (iw_up_in_cloud <= 0 .or. iw_down_in_cloud <= 0, then these arrays were only being zerod out on the CPU and would've getting overwritten by the uninitialized GPU data at the end of the data statement. This change causes the arrays to get correctly zerod out on the GPU when we need.
    
    * Update VariableGroupNondimMoments.py
    
    Fixed a typo
    
    * Merging new changes from master
    
    * Removing need for -gpu=deepcopy, pushing some acc data statements up call tree, and replacing some acc data statements with acc delare statements so that return statements can be added back in.
    
    * Adding back an acc loop that was accidentally removed during a merge.

    Add scripts to configure and run convergence test
     This commit contains new scripts created to configure and run
     convergence test simulations. There are four scripts:
    
     1. run_scripts/run_cnvg_test_multi_cases.csh. This script is used to
        compile and run convergence simulations with specific configurations
        (see details in scripts for explations). After the simulations,the
        space-time convergence plots will also be generated.
    
     2.run_scripts/convergence_config.py: this script "called" by the
       first script to generate the namelist file for CLUBB-SCM simulations.
       With this script, the modified configuration will be applied in the
       case run directory, while the files in default clubb will not be
       touched
    
     3.run_scripts/convergence_function.py: this script contains function
       to modify the initial condition profile for convergence test
       simulations. It is called by run_scripts/convergence_config.py
       when the model is configured to use modified initial conditions
    
     4.run_scripts/plot_l2_convergence.py: this is a sample script to
       generate the space-time convergence plots
