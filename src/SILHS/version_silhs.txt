    Porting pdf_closure subroutine with OpenACC (#1059)
    
    * Porting pdf_closure subroutine with OpenACC
    
    OpenACC directives are added to pdf_closure subroutine. The necessary
    structured data region is also added for optimzing data movement across
    kernels. There is opportunity to task parallelize using streams and
    will be explored in the future.
    
    Answers are bit for bit.
    
    * Fixing the copyin directives
    
    * Making work without managed memory.

    Removing sigma_sqd_w from the acc data copyout statement. This is a bug which was causing the code to crash when not using managed memory.

    Fixing bug, arrays given a dummy index in 0fafc6b0b1f1a6058d37bf3db4bb3708204504db are declared nsize, but are only used up to nlevels, thus we need the (1,1:nlevels) specifier when passing them. This issue was only caught by our _debug tests, so that's good evidence the new flags we added to initialize unused to memory was effective.

    Fixing error causing GPU code not to run. Some variables to be copied were labelled as (ngrdcol,nz) when it should be (:ngrdcol,:nz). I've just removed the data length specifiers completely since they are not neccesary in general.

    Adding OpenACC data directives for mixing length and adg routines
    
    OpenACC structured data regions are added to optimize the data transfers
    between CPU and GPU. These data regions will converted to unstrucutred
    data region in the later optimization phase.
    Results are bit for bit.

    Breaking up column loop in mono_flux_limiter. This may not be the final form for GPUization, but it's definitely a start, no longer do we have to copy single column variables to multicolumn ones anywhere. (#1051)

    Restructuring and Porting of Compute_mixing_length subroutine(Phase 2) (#1054)
    
    * Restructuring and Porting of Compute_mixing_length subroutine(Phase 2)
    
    Restructure: sat_mixrat_liq_2D_acc is being directly called instead of
    calling the 1D version inside the column loop. Changing sat_mixrat_liq_2D_acc
    to a subroutine from a function and adding output array, start_index as
    additional argument. This is a workaround for passing sub-arrays. The OpenACC
    doen't like the sub-arrays being passed and fails the validation.
    
    Porting: OpenACC directives are added inside sat_mixrat_liq_2D_acc for porting
    
    Validation: Answers are Bit for Bit with arm-multicolumn case + nvhpc compiler
    
    * Fix for compilation issues
    
    Issue 1: Missed out declaring 'start_index' while intergrating the
    change
    
    Issue 2: The use of error_code module and the procedures inside it
    causes OpenACC compilation issues when run on the device.
    
    * Removing the sat_mixrat_liq_acc and sat_mixrat_liq_2D_acc, making the normal sat_mixrat_liq work for all current use cases, and making the other versions of sat_mixrat_liq (bolton,gfdl,lookup) functional with OPENACC.
