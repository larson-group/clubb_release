! Parameter file for subroutine tuner_init in there error module. 
! All parameters are used by amoeba or amebsa to "tune" CLUBB.

! f_tol is the degree of accuracy in "tuning" (i.e. the # of digits).
!   Decreasing f_tol results in a tighter criterion of convergence.
! l_results_stdout print all results of tuning to the terminal if true
! l_results_file will generate a new error.in based on the new parameters 
! if true.
! anneal_temp and anneal_iter are only used in amebsa runs;  they determine
!  the starting temperature for the algorithm, and number of times the
!  subroutine is called, respectively.
! tune_type is either 0 for amoeba(downhill simplex method with random restart)
!   or any other integer for amebsa(downhill simplex with simulated annealing)

! Setting t_variables:
! Most variables are named in the same fashion in both CLUBB and the LES, but
!   because some are not they must be specified as an ordered pair of strings.

! Known values of the CLUBB variables and LES variables are listed in the 
! following table:
!  Variables
!  CLUBB      | SAM
!  --------------------
!  cloud_frac | CLD
!  rcm        | QC * 1e-3
!  wp3	      | W3
!  thlm	      | THETAL (without ice)
!  T_in_K     | TABS
!  rtm        | QT * 1e-3
!  um         | U
!  vm         | V
!  wp2        | W2
!  up2        | U2
!  vp2        | V2
!  Values of t_variables for other variables can be found in the .nc files.

! clubb_stats_file is the name of clubb stats file;  This should be the same as 
!   fname_zm  or fname_zm in the statsnl namelist.
! les_stats_file is the name of LES grads data file
! z_i and z_f are levels to look at when tuning. This does not need
!   to be 1 to nz if you wish to optimize for particular altitudes.
!   Note that the first and last z-levels in CLUBB are not prognosed.
! time_nl is the time interval(s) to tune for, in ordered pair form.

! Numbers applied to the parameters are used in the equation:
