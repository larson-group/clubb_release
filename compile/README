This directory contains scripts to compile CLUBB.  The CLUBB single-column model and other programs
use the script here called mkmf to determine Fortran module dependencies.

If you want to compile with the default compiler (GNU Fortran on Redhat Linux):
  ./compile.bash

To compile with a different compiler, pass the .bash script for the compiler
you want to use (found in ./config/) into the compile script:
  ./compile.bash -c [PATH TO CONFIG FILE]

If you want to run the compiler tests, which compiles CLUBB using the g95, gfortran
Oracle, and Intel Fortran compilers:
  ./compiler_tests.bash

For tuning purposes use the -t option. This will not impact standalone runs in a major way,
and definitely does not change the output of CLUBB.
This might slow down climate model runs, hence the changes are hidden behind this option:
  ./compile.bash -t
