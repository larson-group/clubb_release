This directory contains scripts for the various programs that can be used with
the CLUBB parameterization.

generate_seed.bash: 
  Generates a psuedo random seed that is used by the tuner.

run_bin_diff_all.bash: 
  Compares the output for all cases specified in run_scm_all.bash in 
  two specified directories.

run_inputfields.bash: 
  Runs CLUBB with specified prognostic variables from a GrADS or netCDF 
  stats file.

run_jacobian.bash: 
  Runs the CLUBB jacobian program.

run_scm_all.bash: 
  Runs all of the cases CLUBB is set up to do.

  NOTE: 
  You can specify to run the cases in nightly mode using --nightly (or -n).
  In nightly mode, the output is sent to /usr/nightly_tests/nightly_tests/output/CLUBB_current.
  Whatever was in this directory before is copied to  /usr/nightly_tests/nightly_tests/output/CLUBB_previous
  Both of these directories are created if they don't exist.

  You can specify to run only the short cases using --short-cases (or -c).  This omits the 
  gabls2, cloud_feedback_s6, cloud_feedback_s11, cloud_feedback_s12, and twp_ice cases.

  You can specify to run the priority cases using --priority-cases (or -i). This will include
  only the following cases if they are in RUN_CASES: arm, atex,bomex, dycoms2_rf01, 
  dycoms2_rf01_fixed_sst, dycoms2_rf02_ds,dycoms2_rf02_nd, mpace_b, rico, wangara, arm_97,
  cloud_feedback_s6, cloud_feedback_s11, cloud_feedback_s12, gabls3_night, lba, and twp_ice.

  You can specify a manual grid for the runs. This is done
  with the command line options --zt_grid (or -z) and --zm_grid (or -m).
  These options are used by first specifying the desired grid file, then the
  number of grid levels after the command line option -l (or --levels).
  For example, to use a 30-level coarse grid specified on the zt points:
  ./run_scm_all.bash --zt_grid ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd --levels 30
    OR
  ./run_scm_all.bash -z ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd -l 30

  You can specify the timestep to run the cases at using --timestep_test (or -t) followed by a number.
  For example, ./run_scm_all.bash -t 360.

  To specify a custom stats file, use the --stats (or -s) option. For example, to use
  the nightly stats, ./run_scm_all.bash --stats ../input/stats/nightly_stats.in

  To specify a custom parameter file, use the --parameter_file (or -p) option followed by a paramter
  file.

  To run a performance test, use the --performance_test (or -r) option.  This will disable
  statistics output and set debug level to 0 for performance testing.

  To specify a custom output directory, use the --output_directory (or -o).  For example,
  to use the home directory, ./run_scm_all.bash -o $HOME.

RUN_CASES:
  The file RUN_CASES lists all the cases to be run with run_bindiff_all.bash 
and run_scm_all.bash. This makes it easier for external users to run CLUBB 
since they can comment out cases.  It also makes it easier for UWM to add a 
new case.

run_scm.bash: 
  Runs CLUBB for a specified case. The case is specified with the model name.

  NOTE: Optionally, You can specify a manual grid for the runs. This is done
  with the command line options --zt_grid (or -z) and --zm_grid (or -m).
  These options are used by first specifying the desired grid file, then the
  number of grid levels after the command line option -l (or --levels).
  For example, to use a 30-level coarse grid specified on the zt points:
  ./run_scm.bash --zt_grid ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd --levels 30
    OR
  ./run_scm.bash -z ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd -l 30

  You can specify the timestep to run the cases at using --timestep_test (or -t) followed by a number.
  For example, ./run_scm.bash -t 360.

  To specify a custom stats file, use the --stats (or -s) option. For example, to use
  the nightly stats, ./run_scm.bash --stats ../input/stats/nightly_stats.in

  To specify a custom parameter file, use the --parameter_file (or -p) option followed by a paramter
  file.

  To run a performance test, use the --performance_test (or -r) option.  This will disable
  statistics output and set debug level to 0 for performance testing.

  To specify a custom output directory, use the --output_directory (or -o).  For example,
  to use the home directory, ./run_scm.bash -o $HOME.

rum_scm_collect.bash: 
  Runs a case in CLUBB while using the Sun Studio profiler to collect runtime 
  statistics.  For best results, the CLUBB code should be compiled with the Sun
  Studio compiler to use this script.  However, the Intel compiler has been
  confirmed to work as well.  The name of the output directory and optionally
  case name are arguments for the script.

  NOTE: It is highly recommended that no other programs are running on the
  computer that runs this script. If other programs are running, the results
  may be inconsistent and possibly misleading.

run_scm_collect_suite.bash
  Runs a selected set of cases in CLUBB while using the Sun Studio profiler to
  collect runtime statistics for all of them. For best results, the CLUBB code
  should be compiled with the Sun Studio compiler to use this script. However,
  the Intel compiler has been confirmed to work as well. Each case will be run
  a few times to allow for averaging of the runtime statistics. The name of the
  output directory is an argument for the script.  

  NOTE: The output requires about 25 GB of disk space.  Please make sure 
  that enough space is available, and delete these output files when they
  are no longer needed.

  NOTE: It is highly recommended that no other programs are running on the
  computer that runs this script. If other programs are running, the results
  may be inconsistent and possibly misleading.

time_scm_all.bash
  Best used to determine the overall runtime of CLUBB. time_scm_all.bash sets
  the debug level to 0 and turns off the stats output, and runs only the cases
  which do not use microphysics or non-simplified radiation schemes. The script
  requires an argument for the number of runs to perform, and will aggregate
  the overall CPU time taken for all of the runs performed.

run_timestep_tests.bash: 
  Runs all of the cases CLUBB is set up to do. CLUBB is ran several times for 
  each case at different timestep settings.

run_tuner.bash: 
  Runs the CLUBB tuning program. More info can be found in input_misc/tuner/README.
