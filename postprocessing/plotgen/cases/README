Plotgen 3.0 Case Implementation Readme:
=======================================

This is the folder where cases are described. Each case should have its
own case file. For your convenience, there are two template case files to
hopefully make it easier for you to implement a new case.

Follow these steps when implementing a new case:

CLUBB:
======
1. To implement a new case without LES, Best Ever, and 12/17 data, copy 
templates/template_simple.case to <YOUR CASE NAME>.case. If you are implementing a 
case with LES, Best Ever and 12/17 data, copy clubb/templates/template_all.case to 
<YOUR CASE NAME>.case. If you want to plot budgets, copy clubb/templates/template_budget.case
to <YOUR CASE NAME>_budget.case.

2. Open your newly created case file. You can do a find and replace for
all occurrences of case_name to whatever your case name is. For example, 
for cloud_feedback_s12, you would replace all occurrences of case_name
with cloud_feedback_s12 (or whatever you type after run_scm.bash).

3. Test your changes. If you have data, plotgen should automatically plot
it for you. 


SAM-CLUBB:
==========
1. To implement a new case for SAM-CLUBB, follow step 1 from above,
but instead of using clubb/templates, use sam_clubb/templates. 

2. Open your newly created case file. You will need to do a find and replace all
for two variables: SAM_CASE_NAME is the SAM_CLUBB data files (for example, ARM9707),
and CLUBB_CASE_NAME which is the CLUBB file (for example, arm_97_zt.ctl).

3. Test your changes. If you have data, plotgen should automatically plot
it for you.



Some cases are unique, so you may need to modify the case files for your
current situation. The template files are still a good starting point.

Once you are satisfied with the results, commit your new case file. 
You SHOULD ONLY have to create a .case file, and NOT modify any
of the plotgen code. Once your change has been committed, contact
your local system administrator (messneradmin@uwm.edu) and ask them
to create a new RPM for you so your changes can be seen when anyone
executes plotgen (and in the nightly tests). For faster results, you
may want to bring them cookies/cup cakes with your request. Information
on creating the Plotgen RPM can be found here:
