You must have Python installed to run these scripts. In addition, you need NumPy installed to
check the balance of NetCDF formatted files. If you are running NumPy in a virtual environment, 
you may need to edit the first line of the scripts to point to the location of your Python
installation. For example:
#! /home/[username]/[name of virtual environment]/bin/python

checkBudget.py utilizes readBinaryData and pupynere to read binary data files and check if the
budgets balance. It automatically detects if an input file is in NetCDF or GrADS format based
on the extension. The script contains one global variable FILEPATH which indicates the path
to the directory containing the data files in respect to the script. For help with arguments,
simply type "help" as the argument to the script.

readBinaryData.py interperates binary data from GrADS .dat files.

pupynere.py interperates binary data from NetCDF files. It requires that NumPy be included in your
Python installation.
