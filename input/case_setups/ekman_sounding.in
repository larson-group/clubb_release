! The vertical coordinate is entered in the first column as height (z[m]) or pressure (Press[Pa]).
! Temperature can be entered as liquid water potential temperature (thlm[K]), potential temperature (thm[K]), or absolute temperature(T[K]).
! Prescribed, time-independent vertical velocity can be entered as velocity (w[m/s]) or pressure velocity ('omega[Pa/s]')
! If vertical velocity is time dependent, insert missing values throughout column.
! In all cases, missing values are denoted by -999.9
