This directory contains files with statistics that can be output from CLUBB.

Important notes:

Some variables are only non-zero when code options are enabled.  For example, 
the hydrometeors rrainm, ricem, etc. will only be non-zero when a microphysics
scheme is enabled.  Many radiation variables (e.g. upwelling short-wave 
radiative flux) will only be output if BUGSrad is being used.

Attempting to output passive scalar variables (e.g. sclr1m) will only work
if the model is actually transporting a passive scalar (you will get an error
otherwise).

Outputting matrix condition numbers can change your results.  This is because
the subroutines used to obtain those numbers (the LAPACK expert subroutines) 
perform an additional iterative refinement step after computing the solution
that isn't done by the standard subroutines.  Note that these variables also
greatly increase the computational expense of a simulation.  The matrix 
condition number variables are:
'wp23_matrix_condt_num', 'rtm_matrix_condt_num', 'thlm_matrix_condt_num', 
'rtp2_matrix_condt_num', 'thlp2_matrix_condt_num', 'rtpthlp_matrix_condt_num',
'up2_vp2_matrix_condt_num',  and 'windm_matrix_condt_num'.

Some Fortran compilers don't deal well with comments in namelists.  Avoid 
commenting out variable names within the stats namelist when possible.
