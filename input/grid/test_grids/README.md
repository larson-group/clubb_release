# Test grids

These grids where used over the course of the grid adaptation research for testing purposes.
The final grids we ended up with, and that are used in the paper are the `dycore.grd` as dycore grid and the `gr_min.grd` as the prescribed non-normalized minimum grid density $g_\mathrm{min}^\mathrm{(nn)}(z)$.
